This was a Codecademy Project that gave great practice using For Loops, Functions, and Lists. This code takes a given name and destination and finds their interests associated with that destination.

In this project, I defined two basic lists to start. Then I created a function to find the index of where the destination was going to be. Then I created another function to find the index of where the traveler was in the list. Later, I added the various attractions to an empty list, and then retrieved those with another function. Feel free to uncomment a few lines to see more steps in action!
